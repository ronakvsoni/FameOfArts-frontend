# FameOfArts - Frontend

FameOfArts is an app for Artist allowing to upload and manage their paintings by creating multiple Art galleries. It's a Virtual Art gallery so viewers can see each Art gallery's paintings created by Artist. Moreover, they interact, chat with each other via comments.  

## [This is a Demo Video](https://www.loom.com/share/8053fe06d67d4a21883acdce38148c0a) link of the Application
[This](https://github.com/ronakvsoni/FameOfArts-backend) is a link to the back-end repository.

## Motivation

I wanted to create an app that allows Creative art lover audience to connect in a wholesome way, especially if the art lovers are unable to connect in person during the pandemic, So, this is the way they can connect and interact and buy artist's paintings, sculpture whatever they publish virtually and they also can give their feedback.
